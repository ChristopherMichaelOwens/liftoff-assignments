## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a two way searchable database for the purpose of connecting PHD gradutes with positions at companies based on their skillsets. PHD graduates looking for job each have unique skillsets, but it can be hard to connect those skills to positions. PHDs especially have the desire and capability to learn new skills in a career. 

There will be two types of logins, one for employers, and one for job seekers. Employers can input a position, with specifics on the levels of each skill desired, which will match the top candidates using an unnormallized point system, ordered by score. Similarly, Job seekers can input their levels of skills, and do a general search and see which positions their skillset matches with best, and can select/apply for the positions that sound most interesting to them. 

### Features
Login-Job Seekers and Job Posters will each have their own type of login

Create a job posting- Employers can create a job posting, with a text body, and a list of skills, and the priority of those skills that are used in the search.

Create a profile- Job seekers can create a profile with a custom description, and a list of all of their skills, and those skill levels.

Search-Custom matching algorithm orders candidates or job postings by matching score. Job seekers can search for job postings, and employers can search for the perfect candidate.
